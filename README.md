## Requirements

Python 3.6.2

Pytorch 1.7

CUDA 11.2

Numpy 1.19.1

SimpleITK 2.1.1.2
## Data process

The model was trained and evaluated on OAI-ZIB Datasets. This public dataset includes 507 3D DESS MR data with 81120 slices. The pixel spacing is $0.3645mm\times0.3645mm$ and the slice thickness is 0.7mm for all volumetric data. For each volumetric data, it contains 160 slices in $384 \times384$.

For data preprocess, each volume data is cropped into $256\times256$ in center position along the height and width dimension and is cropped randomly along depth (slice) dimension into $32$. The finally data size is $256\times256\times32$.


Our segmentation model is evaluated by four evaluation metrics, which are **Dice score**, **Volumetirc Overlap Error (VOE)**,  **Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD)**. We performed experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Please refer to the original paper for more details.
